# csr_netconf

Library of ncclient python scripts for Cisco CSR/IOSXE

I've uploaded these scripts for anyone dabbling with the NETCONF protocol
and tinkering with Cisco devices namely there Cloud Services Router running
ISOXE 16.X

Some of these scripts will return an string RPC reply to the terminal while
others will return a .xml file that will save to the dir you cloned the repo to.

All scripts have been commented to the point where you should have some idea
what's going on in every line
